Repository that contains my own IoT projects that I've been tinkering with as a hobby. Arduino and Raspberry Pi has been my points of interest so far.

### Current Projects:

##### Arduino Sensor Reader:

```
Project done with Arduino Nano and a bunch of gas sensors. Able to measure readings from three sensors and output them over Bluetooth to a compliant Android device
```

##### Meetingroom Assistant:

```
A device made with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that is able to reserve a designated meetingroom with just a push of a button. This is the source code that operates the device
```

##### Meetingroom Assistant Touch:

```
A device made with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B that is able to reserve a designated meetingroom using a cheap 3.5" touchscreen via the GPIO interface. This is the source code that operates the device
