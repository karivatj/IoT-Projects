Repository that contains my own IoT projects that I've been tinkering with as a hobby. 

### Current Projects:

```


##### Meetingroom Reserver:

```
A device made with Raspberry Pi Zero W that is able to reserve a designated meetingroom with just a push of a button. This is the source code that operates the device
